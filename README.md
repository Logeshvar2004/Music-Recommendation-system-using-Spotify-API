# Step 1: Create a Spotify Account
For a Spotify developer account, you need an account at Spotify. If you don’t use Spotify, create an account. You don’t need to purchase any subscription to get your credentials. Once you have created an account at Spotify (or you already have one) log in to your account from your web browser.

# Step 2: Go to Your Spotify Developer Dashboard
Once you have created an account at Spotify, you need to log in to your Spotify developer dashboard. As you will be using this developer account for the first time, sign the agreement and verify your email. After these steps, we can move to the next step.
